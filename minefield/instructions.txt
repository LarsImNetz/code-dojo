Note: The initial code and test files form a
simple example to start you off.
They are *not* related to the chosen exercise,
whose instructions now follow...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
A field of N x M squares is represented by N lines of 
exactly M characters each. The character '*' represents 
a mine and the character '.' represents no-mine. 

Example input (a 3 x 4 mine-field of 12 squares, 2 of
which are mines)

3 4
*...
..*.
....

Your task is to write a program to accept this input and
produce as output a hint-field of identical dimensions 
where each square is a * for a mine or the number of 
adjacent mine-squares if the square does not contain a mine. 

Example output (for the above input)
*211
12*1
0111
